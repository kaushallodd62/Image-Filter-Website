## Introduction

This web-based Photo Filter allows us to apply multiple CSS filters on images which the user can use to meet his Photo Editing Needs.

Using one or more newer CSS properties (background-blend-mode, mix-blend-mode, or filter) gives us a surprising amount of possibilities to manipulate a single source image.
The unedited background-image is also manipulated using CSS.

These effects should be used as a progressive enhancement. By default, the source image is displayed without any effects. The sliders can be moved to achieve filtering on various properties like brightness, contrast, saturate, grayscale, invert, hue, rotate, blur, opacity, sepia and drop-shadow.

## Usage

You can just run the index.html file and upload the image you want to edit. Move the sliders to suit the effects you want to obtain on the image.
